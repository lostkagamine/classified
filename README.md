## what?
classified is a way to object-orient your Lua code.

class-based workflows in Lua,
then do I have the library for you.

## less-important stuff

### what license is this under?
this project is licensed under the [NVPLv7+](https://git.pixie.town/thufie/npl-builder/).

### how did you do this?
a lot of metatables and abuse of how the lua parser works internally

### why did you do this?
to be honest i don't know.

### can i throw money at you for this atrocity?
[yes you can](https://ko-fi.com/kagaminerin_)

### what versions of lua does this work on?
it was tested on 5.4 and 5.3 and it worked fine there,
but it'll most likely work on any version that supports metatables
